# BCD_to_7-LED_Minecraft
BCD to 7 LED Display Decoder Cicuit made in Minecraft. It coverts the 4 binary inputs (Minecraft switches) using Redstone Circuitry into 0-9 Decimal value which is then displayed into a 7 segment led circuit (Minecraft Glowstones). It was also created to be compact and space efficient unlike other horizontally spread Minecraft Circuits found on the internet.
